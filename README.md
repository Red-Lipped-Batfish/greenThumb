# Green Thumb

Green Thumb is a site for users to look for plants they want to care for. Types of plants can be filtered by factors such as amount of water required, ability for plants to regrow, when plants bloom, how quickly plants can grow, and more. Users can save the plants they are interested on a "plant shelf" and revisit them as consultation for care, or to add personalized notes on the experience caring for the plant.
